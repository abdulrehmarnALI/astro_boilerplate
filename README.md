My take on an AstroJS boilerplate

I've spun up my fair share of web-apps to know the typical patterns. First-night euphoria, a brisk start to whipping up a demo, drop in some compoents, then i remember i still need liniting, tests, and an auth worflow, an API, and some storage. Granted, the order of these to-do items can differ, I thought I'd have a stab at creating an Astro-based boilerplate app. My aim is to codify the boring buts once, so future projects can go straight to feature work. I'm chasing three principles:
  1. Opt-in, not opt-out - A lean core with extras being one flag away
  2. Server-first - SSR is the default. Static export is still possible but Node is the happy path.
  3. Teach by scaffolding - Every phase is deliberately incomplete so I can write the code and earn the muscle memory.

If this all ends well, I'll have a template I trust and some notes that show I think.

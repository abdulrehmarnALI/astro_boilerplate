# Astro
### Why Astro?
Astro is best-known for pioneering a new frontend architecture, known as _islands_, to reduce JavaScript overhead and complexity. Astro websites load fast and have great SEO - but additional features need to be implemented by the developer.

### Features
Astro is an-all-in-one web framework. It includes everything needed to create a website. It also allows hundreds of integrations and API hooks to customise each project.

Some highlights include:

- **Islands** - A component-based web architecture optimised for content-driven websites.
- **UI-agnostic** - Supports React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Slud, HTMX, and more.
- **Server-first** - Moves expensive rendering off of your visitor's device.
- **Zero JS** - less client-side Javascript.
- **Content collections** - organise, validate, and provide TypeScript type-safety for your Markdown content.
- **Customisable** - Partytown, MDX, and hundreds of integrations to choose from.

### Design Principles

#### Content Driven
Astro was designed for building content-rich websites. If we have content to show, it needs to reach our readers quickly.

By contrast, most modern frameworks were designed for building _web applications_. These frameworks excel at building more complex, application-like experiences i the browser: logged-in admin dashboards, inboxes, social networks, to-do lists, and even applications like Figma. 

### Server-first
Astro leverages server rendering over client-side rendering in the browser as much as possible. This is the same approach that traditional server-side frameworks - like PHP, WordPress, Ruby on Rails - have been using for years.

This approach is contrast to modern JS frameworks like Next.js, SveltKit, and Nuxt. These frameworks are dubbed as Single-Page Apps (SPAs) whilst Astro takes a Multi-Page App (MPA) approach.
